# Genetic-Algorithm
FOR SOLVING KNAPSACK PROBLEM
1) Overview: 
In this project, we will implement our first example of a genetic algorithm to solve the
knapsack problem in python. We haven't used any libraries..
2) Goals: 
Did you know that you can simulate evolution inside the computer? And that you can solve
really really hard problems this way? We have tried to solve one historic problem in
computer science by example: The Knapsack problem.
Genetic algorithms are a subgroup of evolutionary algorithms or evolutionary computing
and they are used in self-learning machine learning algorithms and AI. They use the
concept of natural selection to simulate the survival of the fittest and natural selection
inside your computer.
3) MODULES:

 *genetic_algo: 
genetic_algo.py uses the approach to find the best solution for a given Knapsack problem
using the genetic algorithm

 *knapsack: 
It contains all problem-specific parts related to the Knapsack problems, like the definition
of ‘ Things’ and the problem-specific fitness function for the genetic algorithm.

 *Analyze: 
simply contains a utility function we wrote ourselves to measure time using a context
manager.

 *Genetic_time: 
Tells the needed time a genetic algorithm needs for a given number of items.

 *Genetic: 
Inside this module, you find the non-problem-specific parts of the implementation of the
genetic algorithm.
